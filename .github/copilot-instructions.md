# Copilot Instructions

When making any gameplay, UX, content, control, map, battle, quest, item, or UI change in this repository:

1. Always review `README.md` before finishing.
2. If behavior/content changed, update `README.md` in the same edit.
3. In the final response, explicitly state whether `README.md` was updated.
4. If no README change is needed, explicitly state why.

Keep README updates concise and accurate to the implemented behavior.
