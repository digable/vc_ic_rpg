# Copilot Instructions

When making changes in this repository:

1. Always review `README.md` before finishing.
2. Update `README.md` only when adding new areas, bosses, or missions.
3. In the final response, explicitly state whether `README.md` was updated.
4. If no README change is needed, explicitly state why.

Keep README updates concise and accurate to the implemented behavior.
